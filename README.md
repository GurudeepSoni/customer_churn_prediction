# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

A **web-based machine learning application** that predicts customer churn using a **Streamlit-powered user interface**.

🔗 **Live App:** [🌐 Try it on Streamlit Cloud](https://gd-app-customerchurnprediction.streamlit.app/)

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project leverages **machine learning** to predict whether a customer is likely to churn (leave a service).  
Users can input customer details, and the model predicts **churn probability**.  

The frontend is built using **Streamlit**, providing an easy-to-use interface for:

- 🏢 Businesses  
- 📊 Analysts  
- 📈 Marketing teams  

---

## 🔍 Features

- 📝 Input customer data for churn prediction  
- 🧠 Uses **scikit-learn** machine learning models  
- 🌐 Streamlit web app for real-time predictions  
- 📊 Displays prediction results with probability scores  
- 🪄 Simple, interactive, and intuitive UI

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Customer-Churn-Prediction.git
cd Customer-Churn-Prediction
2️⃣ Install dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
3️⃣ Run the Streamlit app
bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
(Replace app.py with your main file name if different)

🧪 Model Info
The model is trained on a customer dataset containing features like:

customer tenure

services used

payment method

monthly charges

contract type

Model Details:

Uses Random Forest / Logistic Regression (or your selected ML model)

Predicts whether a customer will churn or stay

Provides probability scores for better decision-making

You can retrain or fine-tune the model using the included Jupyter notebook:

bash
Copy code
train_model.ipynb
🖼️ Example Output
Customer ID	Predicted Churn	Probability
001	Yes	87.5%
002	No	92.3%

✅ TODO
🌎 Add multilingual support

☁️ Deploy on Streamlit Cloud or Hugging Face Spaces

🔍 Add model explainability (SHAP/LIME)

💾 Optimize model for faster predictions
